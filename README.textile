h1. CRUD module for Play!

This module is a replica of the _play framework_ built-in CRUD module, but adds (doesn't remove) precompiled annotations of the already existing ones:

 * @Exclude
 * @Hidden

So, in case you are building a module using byte-code enhancement that requires those annotations, you can compile your module.

See "Setting up a basic administration area using CRUD":http://www.playframework.org/documentation/1.2.4/guide7 for more information

I hope the small changes are accepted by the _play framework_ team.
